    "Biography of Martin Luther King, Jr. \n",
    " \n",
    "Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929. Dr. King grew up as the son of a leading \n",
    "minister in Atlanta, Georgia, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Sr. His mother, Mrs. Alberta Williams King, \n",
    "assisted her husband in the care of his congregation. Because of their efforts and interest in behalf of \n",
    "the congregation and the community, his parents were known as 'Momma' and 'Daddy' King. His \n",
    "community, centered on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta also influenced him. By the 1930s when he was a \n",
    "child, it was the center of business and social life in Black Atlanta and the major center for the Black \n",
    "Southeast. The community was so successful that nationwide, it was known as \"Sweet Auburn\". The \n",
    "residential neighborhoods of the community, and especially the one where Dr. King was born were \n",
    "known for the diversity of the backgrounds of the residents. Though all Black, the neighborhoods \n",
    "had business people, laborers, college-educated, uneducated, rich, poor and successful all living close \n",
    "to each other.\n",
    "As a boy, Dr. King experienced many of the same things most children do. He helped and played \n",
    "games with his older sister Christine and his younger brother A. D. He played baseball on vacant lots \n",
    "and rode his bicycle in the streets. He went to school at David T. Howard Elementary, three blocks \n",
    "from his home. He attended the Butler Street YMCA down Auburn Avenue. When the family moved \n",
    "to the house on Boulevard, he was attending Booker T. Washington High School, working a \n",
    "newspaper route, attending his first dances, and planning to attend college. But, Dr. King's primary \n",
    "memories of his childhood were of the sting of segregation.\n",
    "In 1941 Daddy King moved the family to a brick home. Here King continued his development and \n",
    "education until he graduated from Morehouse College in 1948. Dr. King still lived in this home when \n",
    "he attended College here in Atlanta, starting at the age of fifteen. After graduation he left for \n",
    "graduate work at Crozer Theological Seminary, then in Chester, Pennsylvania (now Colgate \n",
    "Rochester divinity School/Bexley Hall/Crozer Theological Seminary in Rochester, New York), and at \n",
    "Boston University. He became pastor at The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery Alabama \n",
    "in 1954 and served there until 1960. From 1960 until 1968 he was co-pastor, with his father, of \n",
    "Ebenezer Baptist Church on Auburn Avenue, where his grandfather, Rev. A. D. Williams had also been \n",
    "pastor.\n",
    "Starting with the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955-1956, Dr. King was also the foremost leader of the \n",
    "Civil Rights Movement. His dedication to the tactics of non-violent resistance led to successful \n",
    "campaigns in Montgomery, AL, Birmingham, AL, and Selma,AL as well as encouraging African\u0002Americans throughout the South to campaign for their own freedom. After 1965, He expanded his \n",
    "work to include actions in the North, opposition to the War in Vietnam, and planning for a campaign \n",
    "to aid poor people.\n",
    "Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968 by James Earl Ray.\n",

    "On a hot summer day nearly half a century ago, an African American preacher with no official title or \n",

    "the true equality of all our people. From the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, the Reverend Dr. Martin \n",
    "Luther King, Jr. inspired a movement that would push our country toward a more perfect Union.\n",
    "At a time when our Nation was sharply divided, Dr. King called on a generation of Americans to be \n",
    "\"voices of reason, sanity, and understanding amid the voices of violence, hatred, and emotion.\" His \n",
    "example stirred men and women of all backgrounds to become foot soldiers for justice, and his \n",
    "leadership gave them the courage to refuse the limitations of the day and fight for the prospect of \n",
    "tomorrow. Because these individuals showed the resilience to stand firm in the face of the fiercest \n",
    "resistance, we are the benefactors of an extraordinary legacy of progress.\n",
    "Today, Dr. King is memorialized on the National Mall where he once spoke, a symbol of how far our \n",
    "Nation has come and a testament to the quiet heroes whose names may never appear in history \n",
    "books, but whose selflessness brought about change few thought possible. Dr. King's memorial \n",
    "reminds us that while the work of realizing his remarkable dream is unending, with persistence, \n",
    "progress is within our reach.\n",
    "On the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, we celebrate the man who fought for the America he \n",
    "knew was possible. Dr. King's faith in a God who loves all His children and a Nation grounded in the \n",

    "Nonviolent action campaigns have been a part of political life for millennia, challenging abuses by \n",
    "authorities, spearheading social reforms, demanding an end to colonial rule, and protesting \n",
    "militarism and discrimination.\n",
    "India’s Mohandas Gandhi and the United States’ Martin Luther King \n",
    "Jr., who were both brilliant strategic thinkers as well as great moral \n",
    "leaders, are perhaps the best-known leaders of such movements. Not \n",
    "only were they committed to nonviolent action as the most effective \n",
    "means of waging their respective struggles; they also held to a deep \n",
    "faith-based commitment to nonviolence as a personal ethic. In many \n",
    "respects, however, Gandhi and King were unusual in their personal \n",
    "commitment to principled nonviolence, as the vast majority of \n",
    "nonviolent movements and their leaders have not been pacifists but \n",
    "embraced nonviolent action as the best strategic means to advance their struggles.\n",
    "Indeed, primarily nonviolent struggles in recent decades have not only led to significant political and \n",
    "social reforms advancing the cause of human rights, but have also even toppled repressive regimes \n",
    "from power and forced leaders to change the very nature of their governance. As a result, nonviolent \n",
    "resistance has been evolving from an ad hoc strategy associated with religious or ethical principles \n",
    "into a reflective, even institutionalized, method of struggle.\n",
    "Indeed, the past 30 years have witnessed a remarkable upsurge in nonviolent insurrections against \n",
    "autocratic rulers. Primarily nonviolent “people power” movements have been responsible for \n",
    "advancing democratic change in nearly 60 countries during this period, forcing substantial reforms in \n",
    "many countries. Other struggles, while eventually suppressed, have nevertheless posed serious \n",
    "challenges to other despots.\n",
    "In contrast to armed struggles, these nonviolent insurrections are movements of organized popular \n",
    "resistance to government authority that, either consciously or by necessity, eschew the use of \n",
    "weapons of modern warfare.\n",
    "Unlike conventional political movements, nonviolent campaigns usually employ tactics outside the \n",
    "mainstream political processes of electioneering and lobbying. Tactics may include strikes, boycotts, \n",
    "mass demonstrations, the popular contestation of public space, refusal to pay taxes, destruction of \n",
    "symbols of government authority (such as official identification cards), refusal to obey official orders \n",
    "People-power movements, such as this \n",
    "one in 1989 in Czechoslovakia, have \n",
    "helped bring down scores of \n",
    "authoritarian regimes.\n",
    "5\n",
    "(such as curfew restrictions), and the creation of alternative institutions for political legitimacy and \n",
    "social organization.\n",
    "Why Nonviolence Works\n",
    "For many years there was an assumption that autocratic regimes could be overthrown only through \n",
    "popular armed struggle or foreign military intervention. Yet there is an increasing awareness that \n",
    "nonviolent action can actually be more powerful than violence. A recent academic study of 323 major \n",
    "insurrections in support of self-determination and freedom from autocratic rule over the past \n",
    "century revealed that major nonviolent campaigns were successful 53 percent of the time, whereas \n",
    "primarily violent resistance campaigns were successful only 26 percent of the time. (Maria J. Stephan \n",
    "and Eric Chenoweth. “Why Civil Resistance Works: The Logic of Nonviolent Conflict.” International \n",
    "Security, vol. 33, no. 1, Summer 2008.)\n",
    "There are several reasons why insurgents have turned away from armed struggle to embrace \n",
    "nonviolent action. One reason is a growing awareness of the increasing costs of insurgency warfare. \n",
    "Technology has given status quo powers an increasing advantage in recent years in defeating or at \n",
    "least neutralizing armed insurgencies. Even when an armed revolutionary movement is victorious, \n",
    "large segments of the population are displaced, farms and villages are destroyed, cities and much of \n",
    "the country’s infrastructure are severely damaged, the economy is wrecked, and there is widespread \n",
    "environmental devastation. The net result is an increasing realization that the benefits of waging an \n",
    "armed insurrection may not be worth the costs.\n",
    "Another factor endorsing nonviolence is the tendency, once in power, for victorious armed \n",
    "movements against dictatorships to fail in establishing pluralistic, democratic, and independent \n",
    "political systems capable of supporting social and economic development and promoting human \n",
    "rights. These shortcomings often result in part from counterrevolution, natural disasters, foreign \n",
    "intervention, trade embargoes, and other circumstances beyond a victorious popular movement’s \n",
    "control.\n",
    "However, the choice of armed struggle as a means of securing power tends to exacerbate these \n",
    "problems and creates troubles of its own. For one, armed struggle often promotes the ethos of a \n",
    "secret elite vanguard, downplaying democracy and showing less tolerance for pluralism. Often, \n",
    "disagreements that could be resolved peaceably in non-militarized institutions lead to bloody \n",
    "factional fighting. Some countries experienced military coups or civil wars not long after armed \n",
    "revolutionary movements ousted colonialists or indigenous dictators. Others became overly \n",
    "dependent on foreign powers for weapons to keep them in power.\n",
    "There is also an increasing awareness that armed resistance tends to upset undecided elements of \n",
    "the population, who then seek security in the government. When facing a violent insurgency, a \n",
    "government can easily justify its repression. But force used against unarmed resistance movements \n",
    "usually creates greater sympathy for the government’s opponents. Some have compared this \n",
    "phenomenon with the martial art of aikido, in that the opposition movement leverages the power of \n",
    "state repression to advance the movement’s ends.\n",
    "6\n",
    "In addition, unarmed campaigns involve far more participants beyond the young able-bodied men \n",
    "normally found in the ranks of armed guerrillas, taking advantage of a popular movement’s majority \n",
    "support. Unarmed resistance also encourages the creation of \n",
    "alternative institutions, which further undermine the repressive \n",
    "status quo and form the basis for a new independent and \n",
    "democratic order.\n",
    "Armed resistance often backfires by legitimizing the use of \n",
    "repressive tactics. Violence from the opposition is often \n",
    "welcomed by authoritarian governments and even encouraged \n",
    "through the use of agents provocateurs, because it then justifies \n",
    "state repression. But state violence unleashed on unarmed \n",
    "dissidents often triggers a turning point in nonviolent struggles. A \n",
    "government attack against peaceful demonstrators can be the \n",
    "spark that transforms periodic protests into a full-scale \n",
    "insurrection. \n",
    "Sowing Division\n",
    "Unarmed resistance movements also tend to sow divisions within pro-government circles. There are \n",
    "often disagreements regarding how to deal effectively with the resistance, since few governments \n",
    "are as prepared to deal with unarmed revolts as they are to quash armed ones. Violent repression of \n",
    "a peaceful movement can often alter popular and elite perceptions of the legitimacy of power, which \n",
    "is why state officials usually use less repression against nonviolent movements. In addition, some \n",
    "pro-government elements become less concerned about the consequences of a compromise with \n",
    "insurgents if their resistance is nonviolent.\n",
    "Unarmed movements also increase the likelihood of defections and noncooperation by unmotivated \n",
    "police and military personnel, whereas armed revolts legitimize the role of the government’s \n",
    "coercive apparatus, enhancing its self-perception as the protector of civil society. The moral power \n",
    "of nonviolence is crucial in the ability of an opposition movement to reframe the perceptions of key \n",
    "parties: the public, political elites, and the military, most of whom have no difficulty supporting the \n",
    "use of violence against violent insurrections.\n",
    "The efficacy of nonviolent resistance in dividing supporters of the status quo is apparent not only in \n",
    "rendering government troops less effective, but also in challenging the attitudes of an entire nation \n",
    "and even foreign actors, as in the South African struggle against apartheid. Pictures of peaceful \n",
    "protesters — including whites, members of the clergy, and other “upstanding citizens” — broadcast \n",
    "on television worldwide lent legitimacy to antiapartheid forces and undermined the South African \n",
    "government in a way that the armed rebellion was unable to do. As nonviolent resistance within the \n",
    "country escalated, external pressure in the form of economic sanctions and other solidarity tactics by \n",
    "the international community raised the costs of maintaining the apartheid system.\n",
    "Due to increased global interdependence, the nonlocal audience for a conflict may be just as \n",
    "important as the immediate community. Just as Gandhi played to British citizens in Manchester and \n",
    "London, organizers of the civil rights movement in the U.S. South were communicating to the entire \n",
    "nation, and especially to the administration of President John Kennedy.\n",
    "King and Gandhi embraced nonviolence \n",
    "both in principle and as strategy.\n",
    "7\n",
    "Insurgency within the Soviet bloc was disseminated by television broadcasts that spread the news \n",
    "from country to country, legitimating local protests that no longer seemed like isolated events \n",
    "organized by unstable dissidents. The prominent role of the global media during the anti-Marcos \n",
    "people power movement in 1986 was instrumental in forcing the U.S. government to scale back its \n",
    "support of the Philippine dictator. Israeli repression of nonviolent protests by Palestinians during the \n",
    "first intifada of the late 1980s brought unprecedented international sympathy to their struggle \n",
    "against foreign military occupation. As Palestinian-American scholar Rashid Khalidi observed, the \n",
    "Palestinians had “succeeded at last in conveying the reality of their victimization to world public \n",
    "opinion.”\n",
    "As a proactive ingredient in nonviolent resistance, the creation of alternative structures provides \n",
    "both a moral and a practical underpinning for efforts aimed at bringing about fundamental social \n",
    "change. Parallel structures in civil society may render state control increasingly impotent, as they did \n",
    "throughout Eastern Europe leading up to the events of 1989.\n",
    "In the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos lost power in 1986 not through the defeat of his troops and the \n",
    "storming of the Malacañang Palace, but from the withdrawal of sufficient support for his authority, \n",
    "so that the palace became the only part of the country he could effectively control. On the same day \n",
    "that Marcos was officially sworn in for another term as president in a state ceremony, his opponent \n",
    "— Corazon Aquino, widow of an assassinated Marcos critic — was symbolically sworn in as the \n",
    "people’s president. Given that most Filipinos saw Marcos’s election as fraudulent, the vast majority \n",
    "offered its allegiance to President Aquino rather than to President Marcos. The transfer of allegiance \n",
    "from one source of authority and legitimacy to another is a key element of a successful nonviolent \n",
    "uprising.\n",
    "In the course of a successful nonviolent revolution, and with adequate popular participation, political \n",
    "authority may be wrested from the state and invested in institutions of civil society as these parallel \n",
    "institutions grow in effectiveness and legitimacy. The state may become increasingly impotent and \n",
    "irrelevant as parallel nongovernmental institutions take over an increasing portion of the tasks of \n",
    "governing a society, providing services to the populace, and creating functional equivalents to the \n",
    "institutions of the state.\n",
    "Indigenous Roots\n",
    "Citing the financial support provided by some outside foundations funded by Western governments \n",
    "to some opposition groups that later took part in the so-called color revolutions among nations of \n",
    "Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, some authoritarian regimes have denied the popular \n",
    "legitimacy of these pro-democracy movements by claiming they were simply “soft coups” plotted by \n",
    "the United States or other Western powers. Such outside funding cannot cause a nonviolent liberal \n",
    "democratic revolution to take place, however, any more than Soviet financial and material support \n",
    "for leftist movements in previous decades could cause an armed socialist revolution to take place. \n",
    "One Burmese human rights activist, referring to his country’s centuries-old tradition of popular \n",
    "resistance, noted how the very idea of an outsider having to orchestrate the Burmese people to \n",
    "engage in a nonviolent action campaign is like “teaching a grandma to peel onions.”\n",
    "Successful revolutions, whatever their ideological orientation, are the result of certain objective \n",
    "conditions. Indeed, no amount of money could force hundreds of thousands of people to leave their \n",

    "There is no standardized formula for success that a foreign government or a foreign \n",

    "When people set out to create social change, they have to decide \n",
    "whether to use violence to achieve their aims. Some who opt for \n",
    "nonviolence may have no objection to violence in principle. They just \n",
    "believe that violence will not succeed in gaining their goals, or they \n",
    "are afraid of getting hurt, or they can’t persuade others to join them \n",
    "in violence. Theirs is the nonviolence of convenience, or pragmatic \n",
    "nonviolence.\n",
    "But over the centuries there have been many who might have gained \n",
    "their goals through violence — who had the means, the courage, and \n",
    "the strength to do violence — yet freely decided not to do violence under any circumstances. They \n",
    "followed the way of principled nonviolence. Though many have been inspired to adopt principled \n",
    "nonviolence for emotional and cultural reasons, they have also been moved by the rich intellectual \n",
    "tradition that offers logical arguments on behalf of nonviolence.\n",
    "Nonviolent Vietnam War protests in the \n",
    "1960s followed the example of the civil \n",
    "rights movement.\n",
    "9\n",
    "That intellectual tradition runs like an underground stream through U.S. history. Its roots go back to \n",
    "the Anabaptist Christians of Europe in the 16th century, the era when Protestant Christianity began. \n",
    "The Anabaptists rejected violence because they were committed to staying separated from the \n",
    "mainstream society and its many conflicts. Some of their descendants came to the United States, \n",
    "where they established what are known as the historic peace churches.\n",
    "The distinctive American contribution came when other Christians, who were deeply involved in the \n",
    "conflicts of society, decided on principle to pursue political and social change using only nonviolent \n",
    "means. The process began in colonial times, before the United States declared its independence \n",
    "from Britain, among members of the Society of Friends, known as Quakers. Their strict commitment \n",
    "to nonviolence led some of them to oppose the payment of taxes for war, the enslavement of \n",
    "African Americans, and the persecution and displacement of Native American peoples. But the \n",
    "Quakers were primarily a religious group, whose beliefs led them to nonviolence.\n",
    "The great turning point came in the 1820s and 1830s, when a group of people from different religious \n",
    "backgrounds began to demand the abolition of slavery in the United States. These abolitionists were \n",
    "nearly all Christians, and not all of them were committed to pursuing their goal nonviolently. Those \n",
    "who were, however, created the first group that formed around a goal of political-social change and \n",
    "then chose nonviolence as their means. They believed in God as the supreme ruler of the universe. \n",
    "Therefore, they said, no human should ever exercise authority over another human. On that basis \n",
    "they denounced slavery. But since violence is always a way of exercising authority, they were led \n",
    "logically to renounce violence, too.\n",
    "The same line of thinking influenced the great essayist Henry David Thoreau to go to jail rather than \n",
    "pay taxes to a government that supported war and slavery. In his famous 1849 essay “Civil \n",
    "Disobedience,” Thoreau explained that he would never obey an unjust law, regardless of what \n",
    "punishment he received, because people should follow their own conscience rather than passively \n",
    "follow the government’s demands. Thoreau’s main goal was to maintain his own moral virtue and his \n",
    "freedom to act on the truth as he saw it. But he did point out that if enough people refused to obey \n",
    "unjust laws, they could “clog the machinery” of the state.\n",
    "Tolstoy and Gandhi\n",
    "The writings of the abolitionists and Thoreau inspired the great \n",
    "Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy to become an ardent exponent of \n",
    "Christian nonviolence. His writings, in turn, helped to shape the \n",
    "ideas of the greatest of all nonviolent activists, the leader of India’s \n",
    "independence movement, Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi. In the \n",
    "20th century, the ideas of Tolstoy and Gandhi came back to the \n",
    "United States and inspired many Americans, who often did not know \n",
    "that so much of the theory of nonviolence had originated in their \n",
    "own country.\n",
    "For Gandhi, nonviolence was more a matter of intention than actual behavior. He defined “violence” \n",
    "as the intention to coerce another person to do something the other person does not want to do. \n",
    "Nonviolent actions such as boycotts, blockades, and disobedience to laws may look coercive, but if \n",
    "done in a true spirit of nonviolence, they are merely ways of following the moral truth as one sees it. \n",
    "They leave others free to respond in any way they choose. A follower of Gandhian nonviolence says, \n",

    "know the whole truth, he said, and we must be open to the possibility that we will later see that we \n",
    "were wrong. That is why we must never aim to impose our own views on others. But we must take a \n",
    "firm stand — even unto death — on the truth as we see it now. Only then can we discover for \n",
    "ourselves what the truth is in any given situation.\n",
    "Since principled nonviolence means non-coercion, people committed to nonviolence believe they are \n",
    "never trying to make a situation turn out the way they want it. They are working not for selfish \n",
    "purposes but for the good of the whole world as they see it. In fact, according to Gandhi, they should \n",
    "never be concerned about the outcome of their actions at all. They should only be sure that they are \n",
    "doing the morally right thing at every moment. Following the moral truth is both the means and the \n",
    "end of nonviolence; a right process is the goal. Therefore, nonviolence should not be judged by its \n",
    "ability to produce results.\n",
    "The most famous exponent of nonviolence in the United States was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the \n",
    "great spokesman for the civil rights of African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. King agreed with \n",
    "Gandhi that nonviolent actions must always be taken out of concern for the well-being of all people, \n",
    "even those who are unjust and oppressive. “We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality,” \n",
    "he proclaimed, “tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all \n",
    "indirectly.”\n",
    "Unlike Gandhi, though, King was concerned about the results of his actions. He judged the strategies \n",
    "of the civil rights movement not only by their intrinsic moral virtue, but also by their effectiveness in \n",
    "ending discrimination against black people. He wanted to provoke conflict and win political victories.\n",
    "But as long as one is working nonviolently for justice and equality, King argued, the conflict will yield \n",
    "greater justice and peace for everyone. So in his view, there is no conflict between success for \n",
    "oneself and benefit for society: “We are in the fortunate position of having our deepest sense of \n",
    "morality coalesce with our self-interest.” Even when our acts involve unyielding confrontation and \n",
    "pressure, he said, as long as we are motivated by selfless love offered equally to both sides in the \n",
    "conflict, we are working to harmonize the opposing sides and improve life for all. On that point, \n",
    "Gandhi certainly would have agreed.\n",
    "Results From Nonviolence\n",
    "The civil rights movement demonstrated that nonviolence can produce results, if one chooses to \n",
    "judge by that standard. In the 1960s, the nonviolent movement to end the Vietnam War — largely \n",
    "inspired by the successes of civil rights activists — played a significant role in persuading the U.S. \n",
    "government to remove its troops from Vietnam.\n",
    "Up to the 1960s, most Americans who committed themselves to principled nonviolence were moved \n",
    "by Christian religious beliefs. But the protest movement against the Vietnam War brought in many \n",
    "who were not Christian. The Jewish Peace Fellowship (founded in 1941) grew significantly. An \n",
    "emerging Buddhist peace movement was guided by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hahn and, later, the \n",
    "Dalai Lama.\n",
    "11\n",
    "There were also many more Americans with no religious affiliation who were drawn to nonviolence. \n",
    "They could find inspiration in the writings of the feminist Barbara Deming. Nonviolence is necessarily \n",
    "coercive, she wrote. But it forces people to stop doing only things that they have no moral right to \n",
    "do. It leaves intact their freedom to do whatever they have a right to do. So nonviolence is the most \n",
    "effective way to make lasting social and political change because it is least likely to antagonize the \n",
    "people being forced to change.\n",
    "Since the 1960s, the United States has seen a growing interest in principled nonviolence applied to \n",
    "many political issues, though it still counts only a very small minority of the population among its \n",
    "adherents.\n",
    "Nonviolence movements in the United States have also helped to spawn similar movements around \n",
    "the world. They have achieved major improvements in their conditions of life — most notably, in the \n",
    "overthrow of totalitarian regimes in places from Eastern Europe to the Philippines. Nonviolent \n",
    "activists helped to end long-standing and bitter conflicts in Northern Ireland, Guatemala, and East \n",
    "Timor, among other places. They are now active on numerous fronts in conflict zones around the \n",

    "On March 27, 2006, a Monday, secondary school students in Los Angeles, California, surprised \n",
    "teachers and administrators by staging a school walkout in protest of HR4437, a bill before the U.S. \n",
    "Congress proposing a crackdown on illegal immigrants. This was no ordinary walkout, though, \n",
    "because tens of thousands of students participated, from schools all across the city. The students \n",
    "walking out, a largely Hispanic population, had been inspired to act by a protest by adults in their \n",
    "community that had taken place just two days before. So many students walked out of their schools \n",
    "12\n",
    "and down to City Hall that they blocked traffic as they went, creating a very visible and public display \n",
    "for their cause.\n",
    "The protest had several remarkable aspects, starting with size —\n",
    "tens of thousands of people all taking coordinated political action. \n",
    "Coordinating such a thing at multiple geographic sites at the same \n",
    "time is hard. Getting secondary school students to do so, when most \n",
    "of them are too young to vote, is harder. And involving immigrants, \n",
    "who may never be able to vote, is harder still. Being able to do so \n",
    "without the school administration knowing is nothing short of \n",
    "astonishing — keeping a secret among 30,000 people has never \n",
    "been trivial. And doing it all in 48 hours should have been impossible, \n",
    "would have been impossible, in fact, even a year before.\n",
    "What made a rapid, secret, huge protest happen was the adoption of \n",
    "new communication tools, especially MySpace (the interactive social-networking Web site) and SMS \n",
    "(text messages sent via the phone). Armed with these tools, students could coordinate with one \n",
    "another, not just person to person but in groups. Almost as critically, the messages they exchanged \n",
    "went to the people who mattered — the other students — without reaching the school \n",
    "administrators.\n",
    "Making the school protest possible, though, was not the same as making it happen. What made it \n",
    "happen was real political feeling: The students had a message they wanted to express, together and \n",
    "in public. MySpace and texting amplified that message by giving the messengers abilities they hadn’t \n",
    "had before, but the message itself, a demand for political inclusion in making immigration policy, was \n",
    "independent of the tools.\n",
    "Though some of the early utopianism around new communications tools suggested we were heading \n",
    "into some sort of post-hierarchical paradise, that’s not what is happening now, and it’s not what is \n",
    "going to happen. None of the absolute advantages of large-scale and professional media have \n",
    "disappeared. Instead, what has happened is that most of the relative advantages of those \n",
    "institutions have disappeared — relative, that is, to the media controlled directly by the citizens.\n",
    "The story here is the new ability of uncoordinated groups to achieve the kind of goals such groups \n",
    "have always shared. Human beings are social creatures, not occasionally or by accident, but always, \n",
    "and society isn’t just the product of its individual members; it’s the product of its constituent groups \n",
    "as well. Whenever you improve a group’s ability to communicate with one another, you change the \n",
    "things they are able to accomplish together.\n",
    "Speaking Is Publishing\n",
    "You can see those changes in the altered relationship between citizens and the media: The old saying \n",
    "that freedom of the press exists only for those who own a press points to the significance of the \n",
    "Internet and mobile phones. In the digital realm, to speak is to publish, and to publish online is to \n",
    "open the possibility of connecting with others. With the arrival of a medium where interpersonal \n",
    "communication, public broadcasting, and social coordination shade into one another, freedom of \n",
    "speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association now do so as well.\n",
    "With this blending of conversational, broadcast, and social elements into one medium, we have \n",
    "entered a world where every piece of digital media is a latent community: The people interested in \n",
    "Using communication tools, Los Angeles \n",
    "students organized a surprise \n",
    "demonstration by 30,000 people.\n",
    "13\n",
    "any given bit of writing, picture, or video might well be interested in conversing with one another as \n",
    "well. Being able to synchronize groups via social media is adding a new feature to traditional media; it \n",
    "is becoming not only a source of information, but also a site of coordination. In the case of the Los \n",
    "Angeles walkout, MySpace provided a place for students to publish information about HR4437 (a \n",
    "broadcast function), to talk to one another directly about the bill (a communications function), and \n",
    "to propose a course of communal action (a coordination function), all in one arena.\n",
    "To put it in military terms, digital media can create “shared awareness,” the sense in a group not only \n",
    "that each member understands what is going on, but also that the understanding is similar among \n",
    "all, and, critically, each member understands this as well. Shared awareness is a useful precursor to \n",
    "coordinated action, and the ability to create shared awareness improves with real-time media and \n",
    "with mobile media.\n",
    "A recent application that improves shared awareness using both fast and mobile messages is Twitter, \n",
    "the service that broadcasts short messages from a phone or personal computer to any of your \n",
    "friends who have subscribed to your Twitter “feed.” Though Twitter can be used for any sort of \n",
    "short message, Twitter itself proposes that you use Twitter to answer the question “What are you \n",
    "doing now?”\n",
    "As a result, much of the content on Twitter at any given moment is inane. On a random Thursday \n",

    "activists? As El Fattah describes Twitter, “We use it to keep a tight network of activists informed \n",
    "about security action in protests. The activists would then use Twitter to coordinate a reaction.” \n",
    "Because pro-democracy activists are watched so carefully, Twitter allows them a combination of real\u0002time and group coordination that helps tip the balance of action in their favor.\n",
    "One early use of Twitter had El Fattah and a dozen or so of his colleagues coordinating movements \n",
    "to surround a car in which their friend Malek was being held by the police, to prevent it and him from \n",
    "being towed away. Knowing they were being monitored, they then sent messages suggesting that \n",
    "there were many more of them coming. The police sent reinforcements, surrounding and thus \n",

      "assisted her husband in the care of his congregation., Because of their efforts and interest in behalf of \n",
      "the congregation and the community, his parents were known as 'Momma' and 'Daddy' King., His \n",
      "community, centered on Auburn Avenue in Atlanta also influenced him., By the 1930s when he was a \n",
      "child, it was the center of business and social life in Black Atlanta and the major center for the Black \n",
      "Southeast., The community was so successful that nationwide, it was known as \"Sweet Auburn\"., The \n",
      "residential neighborhoods of the community, and especially the one where Dr. King was born were \n",
      "known for the diversity of the backgrounds of the residents., Though all Black, the neighborhoods \n",
      "had business people, laborers, college-educated, uneducated, rich, poor and successful all living close \n",
      "to each other., \n",

      "to the house on Boulevard, he was attending Booker T. Washington High School, working a \n",
      "newspaper route, attending his first dances, and planning to attend college., But, Dr. King's primary \n",
      "memories of his childhood were of the sting of segregation., \n",
      "In 1941 Daddy King moved the family to a brick home., Here King continued his development and \n",
      "education until he graduated from Morehouse College in 1948., Dr. King still lived in this home when \n",
      "he attended College here in Atlanta, starting at the age of fifteen., After graduation he left for \n",
      "graduate work at Crozer Theological Seminary, then in Chester, Pennsylvania (now Colgate \n",

      "Starting with the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955-1956, Dr. King was also the foremost leader of the \n",
      "Civil Rights Movement., His dedication to the tactics of non-violent resistance led to successful \n",
      "campaigns in Montgomery, AL, Birmingham, AL, and Selma,AL as well as encouraging African\u0002Americans throughout the South to campaign for their own freedom., After 1965, He expanded his \n",
      "work to include actions in the North, opposition to the War in Vietnam, and planning for a campaign \n",
      "to aid poor people., \n",

      "University., His most recent book is Here Comes Everybody:, The Power of Organizing Without Organizations., \n",

      "On March 27, 2006, a Monday, secondary school students in Los Angeles, California, surprised \n",
      "teachers and administrators by staging a school walkout in protest of HR4437, a bill before the U.S. \n",
      "Congress proposing a crackdown on illegal immigrants., This was no ordinary walkout, though, \n",
      "because tens of thousands of students participated, from schools all across the city., The students \n",
      "walking out, a largely Hispanic population, had been inspired to act by a protest by adults in their \n",
      "community that had taken place just two days before., So many students walked out of their schools \n",
      "12\n",
      "and down to City Hall that they blocked traffic as they went, creating a very visible and public display \n",
      "for their cause., \n",
      "The protest had several remarkable aspects, starting with size —\n",
      "tens of thousands of people all taking coordinated political action., \n",
      "Coordinating such a thing at multiple geographic sites at the same \n",
      "time is hard., Getting secondary school students to do so, when most \n",
      "of them are too young to vote, is harder., And involving immigrants, \n",
      "who may never be able to vote, is harder still., Being able to do so \n",
      "without the school administration knowing is nothing short of \n",
      "astonishing — keeping a secret among 30,000 people has never \n",
      "been trivial., And doing it all in 48 hours should have been impossible, \n",
      "would have been impossible, in fact, even a year before., \n",
      "What made a rapid, secret, huge protest happen was the adoption of \n",
      "new communication tools, especially MySpace (the interactive social-networking Web site) and SMS \n",
      "(text messages sent via the phone)., Armed with these tools, students could coordinate with one \n",
      "another, not just person to person but in groups., Almost as critically, the messages they exchanged \n",
      "went to the people who mattered — the other students — without reaching the school \n",
      "administrators., \n",
      "Making the school protest possible, though, was not the same as making it happen., What made it \n",
      "happen was real political feeling: The students had a message they wanted to express, together and \n",
      "in public., MySpace and texting amplified that message by giving the messengers abilities they hadn’t \n",
      "had before, but the message itself, a demand for political inclusion in making immigration policy, was \n",
      "independent of the tools.\n",
      ", Though some of the early utopianism around new communications tools suggested we were heading \n",
      "into some sort of post-hierarchical paradise, that’s not what is happening now, and it’s not what is \n",
      "going to happen., None of the absolute advantages of large-scale and professional media have \n",
      "disappeared., Instead, what has happened is that most of the relative advantages of those \n",
      "institutions have disappeared — relative, that is, to the media controlled directly by the citizens., \n",
      "The story here is the new ability of uncoordinated groups to achieve the kind of goals such groups \n",
      "have always shared., Human beings are social creatures, not occasionally or by accident, but always, \n",
      "and society isn’t just the product of its individual members; it’s the product of its constituent groups \n",
      "as well., Whenever you improve a group’s ability to communicate with one another, you change the \n",
      "things they are able to accomplish together., \n",
      "Speaking Is Publishing\n",
      "You can see those changes in the altered relationship between citizens and the media:, The old saying \n",
      "that freedom of the press exists only for those who own a press points to the significance of the \n",
      "Internet and mobile phones., In the digital realm, to speak is to publish, and to publish online is to \n",
      "open the possibility of connecting with others., With the arrival of a medium where interpersonal \n",
      "communication, public broadcasting, and social coordination shade into one another, freedom of \n",
      "speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association now do so as well.\n",
      ", With this blending of conversational, broadcast, and social elements into one medium, we have \n",
      "entered a world where every piece of digital media is a latent community: The people interested in \n",

      "well., Being able to synchronize groups via social media is adding a new feature to traditional media; it \n",
      "is becoming not only a source of information, but also a site of coordination., In the case of the Los \n",
      "Angeles walkout, MySpace provided a place for students to publish information about HR4437 (a \n",
      "broadcast function), to talk to one another directly about the bill (a communications function), and \n",
      "to propose a course of communal action (a coordination function), all in one arena., \n",
      "To put it in military terms, digital media can create “shared awareness,” the sense in a group not only \n",
      "that each member understands what is going on, but also that the understanding is similar among \n",
      "all, and, critically, each member understands this as well., Shared awareness is a useful precursor to \n",
      "coordinated action, and the ability to create shared awareness improves with real-time media and \n",
