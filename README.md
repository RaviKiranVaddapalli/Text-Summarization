# Text-Summarization
Given any text, summary will be produced by means of sentence scoring

**************************************************************************************************************************************************************
This project is done along with my team during the internship post completion of my Data Science Certification.
I did the entire deployment part of this project and also some minor changes in the algorithm for summarization.
Deployment is done using Streamlit.

At first, we have taken a text document that is entirely a static input and gives a standard output.
And then, I thought of extending this project to accept any input text and solely worked on it and modified the entire code to generate the summaries.
